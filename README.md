📝 A team based project to create an iOS Detective App in less than two weeks, all with no prior experience coding in Xcode & Swift. We hope you enjoy a challenge as much as us; you're going to need all your problem solving skills to become a Master Detective!  

Use geolocation to travel to the site of each crimescene and begin the next challenge in pursuit of the infamous Jack the Ripper.  
Use your detective skills to solve a different challenge at each site, unlocking the next location. Take care, wrong answers will cost you points towards ranking up your Dective level.

# Coding with Swift & XCode

- Unlike Ruby or JS; Swift is a static typed language - the type of a variable is known at compile-time, instead of at run-time. Once a variable has been declared with a type, it cannot be re-assigned to a different type.
- Swift is strongly typed. When using a variable or passing a function an argument; Swift checks that it is of the correct type. 
    eg. a string can't be passed to a function that expects an integer. 
- Whilst this adds extra steps to development, it helps to catch mistakes & errors early.
